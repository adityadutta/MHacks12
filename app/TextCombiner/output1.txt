The motion of an aircraft through the air can be explained and described by physical principals discovered over 300 years ago by Sir Isaac Newton
 Some twenty years later, in 1686, he presented his three laws of motion in the "Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis
Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force
 The key point here is that if there is no net force acting on an object (if all the external forces cancel each other out) then the object will maintain a constant velocity
 If that velocity is zero, then the object remains at rest
The second law explains how the velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to an external force
 (Calculus can also be used to determine the velocity and location variations experienced by an object subjected to an external force
) For an object with a constant mass m, the second law states that the force F is the product of an object's mass and its acceleration a:F = m * aFor an external applied force, the change in velocity depends on the mass of the object
 In other words, if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B also exerts an equal force on object A
 Notice that the forces are exerted on different objects
