# <center> School Notes Optimization </center>

Our MHacks project for 2019 is a web app used to help students better utilize their notes in class. The theme is 'social good' and we thought finding a way to make a better learning environment would fit this theme.

Our goals are:

> -   use machine learning to compress all students notes and make one master notes document
> -   translate in as many languages as possible
> -   allow note sheets to be sent 'offline' (via text)

Tech stack:

> -   Python 3 + Flask framework
> -   Firebase backend
> -   REST API calls with Postman
> -   HTML, CSS, JS frontend
