# <center> ZipNotes </center>

Our MHacks project for 2019 is a web app used to help students better utilize their notes in class. The theme is 'social good' and we thought finding a way to make a better learning environment would fit this theme. As well, we implemented the Twilio API to allow students with limited internet, such as those in third world countries, to access the notes by SMS or VoIP.

Our goals are:

> -   use machine learning to compress all students notes and make one master notes document
> -   translate in as many languages as possible
> -   allow note sheets to be sent 'offline' (via text)

Tech stack:

> -   Python 3 + Flask framework
> -   Firebase backend
> -   REST API calls with Postman
> -   HTML, CSS, JS frontend
> -   Twilio SMS API for notes access in third world countries where internet is limited.
